Sentiment Analysis (Twitter)

What is Data Scraping ?
Data scraping, also known as web scraping or data harvesting, is the process of extracting large amounts of data from websites and storing it in a structured format, such as a spreadsheet or a database. It involves writing software code that automatically accesses and extracts specific information from web pages, such as product prices, contact details, customer reviews, news articles, or social media posts, and saves it for further analysis or use. Data scraping can be performed manually, but it is typically done using automated tools and techniques that can crawl through multiple pages of a website, follow hyperlinks, and extract data from unstructured or semi-structured data sources. Data scraping has many applications in business, research, and marketing, including market intelligence, competitor analysis, lead generation, and data enrichment. However, data scraping can raise legal and ethical concerns, particularly when it involves accessing proprietary or sensitive information or violates the terms of use of a website.


What is Sentiment Analysis ? 
Sentiment analysis is the process of using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and extract subjective information from a text corpus, such as opinions, attitudes, emotions, and feelings expressed by individuals or groups of individuals towards specific topics, products, services, or events. Sentiment analysis is commonly used in various applications, such as social media monitoring, market research, customer feedback analysis, brand reputation management, and political analysis. Sentiment analysis can be performed using various techniques, including rule-based systems, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning models.
